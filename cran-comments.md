* fixed bug in handling `Date` and `Posix` clases

* New gcc compiler warning : https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/gcc8/geojsonsf.out
  - this warning references the souce C++ library `rapidjson`. There is an issue on their github page to fix this (https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/issues/1205). I will update this package once rapidjson has fixed this warning.
